This is an early start on what will be a boilerplate for previous work and code samples.
Primary objective is as a learning experience in:
- Express
- Node
- Dust
- React

Current status: concentrating on tooling, some progress in:
- Heroku deployment
- build scripts in npm
- Express setup
- Dust templating engine in place
- Webpack

**Please note this is currently on the freebie Heroku plan which can take a few seconds to spin up!**
